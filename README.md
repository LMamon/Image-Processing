# Image Processing

This project is an inttroduction to image processing and computer vision. It demonstrates how to analyze geometric properties of objects/shapes in binary images. Includes more image processing operations for color images including: linear and non-linear image filters, and converting to fourier transforms using the openCV library.

## Features
- Converts color images to binary.
- Detects and analyzes shape properties, including:
  - Centroids
  - Major and minor axes
  - Moments
  - Orientation
- Image Processing: 
  - Linear and non-linear image filters
  - Fourier transformation
- Features (coming soon):
  - Edge detection
  - Boundary detection
  - Image stitching
  - Face Detection 

- Visualizes results of a processed image.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
