# Binary images analysis

This project is an inttroduction to image processing and computer vision. It demonstrates how to analyze geometric properties of objects/shapes in binary images, LSIS+ convolution, linear and non-linear image filters, and converting to fourier transforms using the openCV library.

## Features
- Converts color images to binary.
- Detects and analyzes shape properties, including:
  - Centroids
  - Major and minor axes
  - Moments
  - Orientation
- Visualizes results on a processed image.
- Image Processing (currently under construction) : 
  - Linear and non-linear image filters
  - Fourier transforms

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/LMamon/Image-Processing.git>
   cd <repository-folder>
